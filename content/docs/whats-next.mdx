## Congratulations

You've gotten started with Claude Code.

That's not a small thing. Most people are still copying and pasting into chat windows, re-explaining themselves every session, and getting generic advice back. You're past that. You have:

- **A project that Claude knows** — context, memory, rules that persist across sessions
- **An identity Claude understands** — your role, your style, your audience
- **A team you can deploy** — agents for parallel work, sub-agents for different perspectives
- **A workflow that scales** — plan first, then execute; reference files, not paste text

You're not just using AI. You're working *with* it — the way a chief of staff works with a principal. Claude handles the prep, the research, the drafting. You make the decisions.

## What You Built

| Module | What you walked away with |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Module 0: Getting Started** | Claude Code installed, course project cloned, first conversation |
| **Module 1: Fundamentals** | File exploration, @ references, Plan mode, agents, sub-agents, CLAUDE.md |
| **Module 2: Context** | Identity file, company context, personal style guide — Claude sounds like you |

This is a real toolkit. Use it Monday morning. Prep for a client call. Summarize a folder of research. Draft an email in your voice. The more you use it, the sharper it gets.

## Beyond This Course

Once you're comfortable with the fundamentals, there's a whole next level of capabilities to explore:

| Capability | What it is | Why you'd want it |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Custom Skills** | Turn your best prompts into reusable `/commands` | Stop rewriting the same instructions every time |
| **Plugins (MCP)** | Connect Claude to Slack, Google Calendar, Notion, and other tools | Claude works across your real tools, not just local files |
| **Claude Desktop Plugins** | Integrations built into the Claude desktop app | Use AI features directly inside the apps you already use |
| **Cowork Mode** | Claude works in the background while you do other things | Like having a colleague working on your project overnight |
| **Hooks** | Automatic actions that trigger on specific events | Set up workflows that run themselves |

You don't need any of these right now. The fundamentals carry you through 90% of daily work. When you're ready for more, these tools are waiting.

## Keep Going

The best way to learn is to use Claude Code on your real work — not course exercises. Start a new project folder, create a CLAUDE.md with your actual business context, and start asking Claude to help with the things on your plate this week.

You've got the foundation. Now go build on it.
