description: Download the course project and launch Claude Code in it. Five minutes to your first lesson.

**Time to complete:** 5 minutes | **Prerequisites:** Claude Code installed ([0.1](/docs/getting-started/installation))

## Pick Your Download Method

There are three ways to get the course files. Pick whichever feels most comfortable.

<Tabs items={["One-Line Command (Recommended)", "Let Claude Do It", "Manual Download"]}>
<Tab>

### Option 1: One-Line Command

Open your terminal and paste this single command:

```bash
cd ~/Documents && git clone https://github.com/sweiwong/ai-as-your-cos.git && cd ai-as-your-cos && claude "/start-1-1"
```

**What this does:** Downloads the course files to your Documents folder, moves into the project, and immediately launches Claude Code with the first lesson.

That's it — you're in. Skip to the bottom of this page if you need the "How Claude Code Is Different" overview, otherwise you're already running Lesson 1.1.

<Callout type="idea" title="Git not installed?">
If you see an error about `git`, launch Claude Code anywhere by typing `claude`, then ask:

```
Help me install git on my computer
```
</Callout>

</Tab>
<Tab>

### Option 2: Let Claude Do It

If you'd rather not copy terminal commands, let Claude handle the whole thing.

<Steps>
<Step>
Open your terminal and type `claude` to launch Claude Code
</Step>
<Step>
Tell Claude:

```
Clone the course repo from https://github.com/sweiwong/ai-as-your-cos.git
into my Documents folder, then open it
```

Claude will run the commands for you — just approve when it asks for permission.
</Step>
<Step>
Once you're in the project folder, type `/start-1-1` to begin Module 1.
</Step>
</Steps>

</Tab>
<Tab>

### Option 3: Manual Download

If you prefer downloading a ZIP file:

<Steps>
<Step>
Go to [github.com/sweiwong/ai-as-your-cos](https://github.com/sweiwong/ai-as-your-cos)
</Step>
<Step>
Click the green **Code** button, then **Download ZIP**
</Step>
<Step>
Extract the ZIP file to your Documents folder
</Step>
<Step>
You should now have a folder at `~/Documents/ai-as-your-cos`
</Step>
</Steps>

Then follow the "Open Claude Code from the Course Folder" section below.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Open Claude Code from the Course Folder

If you used Option 1, you're already running. For Options 2 and 3, you need to open Claude Code inside the course folder.

**GUI method (easiest):**
1. Open Finder and navigate to Documents → `ai-as-your-cos`
2. Right-click the folder → **New Terminal at Folder** (or **Services → New Terminal at Folder**)
3. Type `claude` and press Enter

**Terminal method:**
```bash
cd ~/Documents/ai-as-your-cos
claude
```

<Callout type="warn" title="This matters">
**Claude only sees files in the folder where you launch it.** If you start Claude Code from your home directory, it won't see the course files. Always launch it from inside the `ai-as-your-cos` folder.
</Callout>

## Start Your First Lesson

Once Claude Code is running inside the course folder, type:

```
/start-1-1
```

This launches the interactive exercises for Module 1, Lesson 1. Each lesson in this course has a `/start` command that sets up hands-on practice right in your terminal.

## How Claude Code Is Different From ChatGPT

If you're coming from ChatGPT or Claude.ai in a browser, here's the key shift:

| | Browser Chatbot (ChatGPT, Claude.ai) | Claude Code |
|---|---|---|
| **File access** | You upload or paste text manually | Claude reads files directly from your computer |
| **Memory** | Starts fresh every conversation | Remembers project context through CLAUDE.md |
| **Scope** | One conversation at a time | Can work across multiple files at once |
| **Real work** | Good for quick questions | Good for actual tasks in your business |

You don't need to learn special syntax. You talk to Claude Code in plain English — just like briefing a colleague. The difference is that Claude Code can see your files, remember your preferences, and take action on your behalf.
