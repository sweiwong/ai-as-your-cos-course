**Run `/start-1-6` in Claude Code to begin the interactive exercises for this lesson.**

## Agents vs. Sub-agents

In the last lesson, you used agents — temporary workers that spin up for one task and then they're gone. Custom sub-agents are different: they're permanent. They live in your project folder and are always available, like having dedicated team members on staff.

| | Agents (Lesson 1.5) | Custom Sub-agents (this lesson) |
|---|---|---|
| **Lifespan** | Temporary — exist for one task | Permanent — always available |
| **Purpose** | Volume and batch processing | Wisdom, perspective, and feedback |
| **Analogy** | "10 interns processing files" | "An advisory board reviewing your strategy" |
| **Where they live** | Created on the fly in conversation | `.claude/agents/` folder in your project |

## How Sub-agents Work

Sub-agents are text files in the `.claude/agents/` folder. Each file defines a persona — who the sub-agent is, what they're good at, and how they communicate.

When you reference a sub-agent by name, Claude reads that file and adopts the persona for the task.

## Your Course Project Already Has Three

The starter repo you cloned comes with three sub-agents in `.claude/agents/`:

| Sub-agent | File | What they do |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Strategist** | `strategist.md` | Business strategy, frameworks, positioning options with tradeoffs |
| **Editor** | `editor.md` | Writing quality — clarity, structure, tone matching, cutting filler |
| **Researcher** | `researcher.md` | Market data, competitor analysis, structured findings with confidence levels |

**To use them, just reference them by name:**

```
Have the Strategist review this market entry plan and give me three alternative approaches with tradeoffs
```

```
Editor, review @proposal.md and tighten the language. Flag anything generic.
```

```
Researcher, what's the current market size for corporate meditation apps? Include confidence levels.
```

## Creating Your Own Sub-agents

You can create new sub-agents two ways:

**Option 1: Ask Claude to create one**
```
Create a sub-agent at .claude/agents/skeptic.md with this persona:

You are a skeptical investor who has seen hundreds of pitches fail.
When reviewing any plan or proposal, you look for: unrealistic
assumptions, missing market data, unclear unit economics, and
wishful thinking. You're not negative — you're rigorous. Your
feedback makes plans stronger.
```

**Option 2: Use the `/agents` command**

Type `/agents` in Claude Code to see your current sub-agents and create new ones interactively.

<Callout type="info">
After creating a new sub-agent, restart Claude Code (`/quit` then `claude`) for it to appear in the `/agents` list.
</Callout>

## The Advisory Team Concept

The most powerful use of sub-agents is building an advisory team — a group of personas you consult regularly for different perspectives on the same decision.

```
Get feedback from the Strategist, Editor, and Researcher on this quarterly plan.
Then synthesize their input into a final recommendation.
```

Here are some advisory team ideas for different scenarios:

| Scenario | Sub-agents to create |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Resume or job application** | Recruiter + Hiring Manager + Career Coach |
| **Business idea validation** | Skeptical Investor + Target Customer + Realist Operator |
| **Presentation review** | Busy Executive + Detail-Oriented Analyst + Skeptic |
| **Writing review** | Editor + Target Reader + Harsh Critic |
| **Big decision** | Risk-Averse Advisor + Opportunity-Focused Advisor + Pragmatist |

## What Makes a Good Sub-agent File

A strong sub-agent definition includes:

1. **Role** — who they are and what perspective they bring
2. **How they work** — what they look at, what files they reference
3. **Output format** — how they structure their feedback
4. **Quality bar** — what standard they hold work to

Look at the existing sub-agents in `.claude/agents/` for good examples. The `editor.md` file includes a checklist. The `strategist.md` file includes a structured output format with options and tradeoffs.
