# AI as your Chief of Staff

A hands-on course for solopreneurs, founders, and consultants who want to use AI to build an augmented YOU.

## Who This Is For

* You're a non-technical professional. You've used ChatGPT, maybe Gemini. You know AI is powerful, but you're stuck at "write me an email" and want to go further. You don't code, and you don't want to. You want AI that actually understands you, your business and saves you real hours every week.

* You have used ChatGPT. You type a question. You get an answer. You hear it is all about 'prompts'. You write longer and longer prompts for context. Then you copy the answer into a document, reformat it, etc. The next day, you start all over AGAIN explaining who you are, what you need, how to work with you. You wonder what everyone else is going on about thinking AI is amazing. 

* You have been hearing everyone (ie. Wei) talk about Claude Code this, Claude Code that... and think, how do I get started? 


## The Mental Model Shift

<div className="comparison-block">

**Old model:** I ask questions. I get answers. I copy-paste.

**New model:** I bring the AI into my project. It reads my files, knows my context, and does work alongside me.

Claude Code isn't a chatbot. It's an AI that works directly with your files and computer:

| What it does | Example |
|---|---|
| 📄 Reads & edits documents | User research, PRDs, data files |
| ⚡ Runs in parallel | 10 instances processing 10 files simultaneously |
| 🧠 Remembers context | Knows your product across every session |
| 🖼️ Analyzes visuals | Screenshots and mockups you paste |
| 👥 Acts as reviewers | Engineer, executive, UX — before you share |
