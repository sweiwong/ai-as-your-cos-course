title: "1.2: File Exploration & Visual Workspace"
description: Set up your dual-pane workspace and learn how Claude Code explores files and folders.

**Run `/start-1-2` in Claude Code to begin the interactive exercises for this lesson.**

## The Problem

The terminal is great for talking to Claude — but you can't see your files. You're working blind. When Claude creates or edits a file, you have to ask it to show you the contents rather than just glancing at it.

**The solution:** Use a visual editor alongside Claude Code. Left side = file explorer (see everything). Bottom panel = Claude Code terminal (work with everything).

## Setting Up Your Editor

<Tabs items={["Nimbalyst (Recommended)", "Cursor"]}>
<Tab>

### Nimbalyst

Best for non-technical users. WYSIWYG markdown editing, built-in Claude Code terminal, and it shows the `.claude/` folder (where your agents and commands live).

**Setup:**
1. Download from [nimbalyst.com](https://nimbalyst.com) (free)
2. Open the app and navigate to your `ai-as-your-cos` folder
3. The built-in terminal is at the bottom — type `claude` to launch Claude Code

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| WYSIWYG markdown | Edit `.md` files visually, no syntax to learn |
| Claude Code | Built into the terminal panel |
| `.claude/` folder | Visible in the file explorer |
| Price | Free |

</Tab>

### Cursor

Best if you want Cursor's own AI features alongside Claude Code. It's built on VS Code, so it works with any VS Code extensions.

**Setup:**
1. Download from [cursor.com](https://cursor.com) (free)
2. File → Open Folder → select your `ai-as-your-cos` folder
3. Open the terminal panel (`Ctrl+backtick` or View → Terminal)
4. Type `claude` in the terminal to launch Claude Code

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| AI features | Cursor's own AI + Claude Code in terminal |
| VS Code compatible | All extensions work |
| `.claude/` folder | Visible in file explorer |
| Price | Free |

## Exploring Files With Claude

Once you have your editor open alongside Claude Code, try these prompts to explore the course project:

<Cards>
<Card title="See the file structure">
```
Show me the folder structure of this project. List the main folders and what each one contains.
```
</Card>
<Card title="Summarize a folder">
```
What files are in the research/ folder? Give me a one-line summary of each.
```
</Card>
<Card title="Read a specific file">
```
Read CLAUDE.md and tell me what project this is about.
```
</Card>
</Cards>

Claude reads the actual files on your computer — no uploading, no copy-pasting. You ask, it reads, it responds.

## Markdown Files

You'll see lots of `.md` files in the course project. Markdown is a simple text format that both humans and AI can read easily.

- **In your editor:** Most editors preview markdown with formatting (headers, bold, bullet points)
- **In Nimbalyst:** Markdown renders visually by default — what you see is what you get
- **In Cursor:** Press `Cmd+Shift+V` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+V` (Windows) to preview

<Callout type="idea">
Markdown is the universal language of AI tools. When Claude creates files for you, they'll usually be in markdown format — readable by you, readable by any other AI tool, and easy to share.
</Callout>

## Real-World Applications

File exploration isn't just a learning exercise. This is one of the most practical things Claude Code does:

| Scenario | What to ask Claude |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Inherited a project** at work | "Explore this folder and tell me what's here and how it's organized" |
| **Messy Downloads folder** | "Look at ~/Downloads and categorize everything by file type" |
| **Starting a new job** | "Read through this project folder and give me an orientation summary" |
| **Client sent a folder** of files | "Summarize each file in this folder and tell me what needs my attention" |
| **Brand assets** scattered everywhere | "Find all image and document files and organize them into a summary" |

## Start the Exercises

Switch to Claude Code and run:

```
/start-1-2
