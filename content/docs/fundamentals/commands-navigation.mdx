**Run `/start-1-4` in Claude Code to begin the interactive exercises for this lesson.**

## Plan First, Then Execute

This is the single most important workflow in Claude Code — especially when you're starting out.

Type **`/plan`** to enter Plan mode. Claude will show you exactly what it intends to do *before* it does anything. You review the plan, approve it, and then Claude executes. (You can also press **Shift+Tab** to cycle between modes.)

**Why this matters:** Without Plan mode, Claude just starts making changes. That's fine once you're experienced, but when you're learning, you want to see the roadmap before the car starts moving.

<Callout type="warn" title="The golden rule">
**When in doubt, use Plan mode.** You can always switch to a faster mode later. You can never undo changes you didn't understand.
</Callout>

### The Three Modes (`/plan`, `/edit`, `/auto-accept` — or Shift+Tab to cycle)

| Mode | What Claude does | When to use it |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Plan** | Shows a plan first, waits for your approval, then executes | Complex tasks, anything you want to understand before it happens |
| **Edit** (default) | Asks permission before each individual file change | Learning, being careful with each step |
| **Auto-accept** | Makes changes without asking | Speed, simple tasks you trust completely |

### The Plan → Execute Workflow

<Steps>
<Step>
Type **`/plan`** to switch to Plan mode
</Step>
<Step>
Describe what you want — for example: "Reorganize my research files by competitor"
</Step>
<Step>
Claude shows you a step-by-step plan: what it will create, move, edit, and delete
</Step>
<Step>
You review the plan. If it looks right, tell Claude to go ahead. If not, ask it to adjust.
</Step>
</Steps>

Think of it like a contractor showing you the blueprint before starting construction. You wouldn't let someone start knocking down walls without seeing the plan first.

## Slash Commands

Slash commands are shortcuts that start with `/`. Type them at the Claude Code prompt to control your session. Here are the most useful ones:

### Session Management

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/clear` | Start a fresh conversation (keeps your files) |
| `/compact` | Compress the conversation to save context space |
| `/resume` | Pick up where you left off after closing Claude Code |

### Models & Usage

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/model` | Switch between models — **Sonnet** (fast, good for most tasks) and **Opus** (slower, better for complex reasoning) |
| `/usage` | See how much of your usage limit you've consumed |
| `/cost` | See the cost of your current session |

### Context & Files

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/context` | See what Claude currently knows about (files, CLAUDE.md, etc.) |
| `/add-dir` | Add another folder for Claude to see |
| `/init` | Create a CLAUDE.md file for your project |
| `/memory` | View and edit your project memory |

### Agents & Permissions

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/agents` | See available sub-agents in your project |
| `/permissions` | Manage what Claude can do without asking |

### Configuration

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/config` | Open settings |
| `/doctor` | Diagnose common issues |
| `/terminal-setup` | Set up terminal integration |

### Custom Slash Commands

Files in your `.claude/commands/` folder become slash commands. That's how the `/start-1-1` commands in this course work — they're just text files that Claude reads as instructions.

After adding a new command file, restart Claude Code to pick it up.

## Essential Keyboard Shortcuts

### Escape to Interrupt

Press **Escape** to stop Claude mid-response. Useful when Claude is going in the wrong direction or you've seen enough.

### Rewind (Esc × 2)

Press **Escape twice quickly** to rewind. This gives you two options:

1. **Reset conversation only** — undo the last exchange but keep any file changes
2. **Reset conversation AND undo file changes** — like time travel, restoring files to before the last exchange

<Callout type="idea">
Rewind is one of the most useful features. Made a mistake? Asked the wrong question? Claude went off track? Just press Escape twice and try again.
</Callout>

### Other Shortcuts

| Shortcut | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| **Escape** | Stop Claude mid-response |
| **Esc × 2** | Rewind (undo last exchange) |
| **Shift+Tab** | Cycle through input modes |
| **Ctrl+backtick** | Toggle terminal in your editor |
| **Ctrl+V** | Paste images into Claude Code |

## Think Keywords

When you need Claude to reason more carefully, add a "think" keyword to your prompt:

| Keyword | What happens |
|---------|-------------|
| `think` | Normal thinking — Claude pauses to reason before answering |
| `think harder` | Deeper analysis — for problems with multiple angles |
| `ultrathink` | Maximum reasoning power — for the most complex tasks |

You'll see a thinking indicator while Claude reasons. `ultrathink` shows a rainbow indicator — that's how you know it's working hard.

```
Think harder about the best way to organize my client files.
Consider how I'll need to find things six months from now.
```

## Start the Exercises

Switch to Claude Code and run:
