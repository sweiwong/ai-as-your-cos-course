title: "1.7: Project Memory (CLAUDE.md)"
description: Set up CLAUDE.md so Claude remembers your business context, rules, and preferences — every single session.

**Run `/start-1-7` in Claude Code to begin the interactive exercises for this lesson.**

## The Re-Explanation Problem

Every time you start a new ChatGPT conversation, you start from zero. You have to explain who you are, what you're working on, and how you like things done — every single time. It's like briefing a new assistant from scratch every Monday morning.

CLAUDE.md fixes this. It's a text file that lives in your project folder. Every time you launch Claude Code in that folder, it reads this file automatically — before you say anything. It's your project's permanent memory.

<Callout type="idea">
**Think of it as a constitution for your AI assistant.** Your CLAUDE.md sets the rules that always apply. If a prompt contradicts your CLAUDE.md, the CLAUDE.md wins — just like a constitution overrides regular legislation.
</Callout>

## Your Course Project Already Has One

The `ai-as-your-cos` folder you cloned has a CLAUDE.md at the root. It tells Claude that you're a strategy consultant working on a wellness app market analysis for a client called Stillpoint. That's why Claude knows about the project without you explaining it each time.

## What to Put In (and What to Leave Out)

**Good things to include:**

| Category | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Your role and business | "I'm a solo consultant specializing in ops for e-commerce brands" |
| Communication style | "Write in a direct, warm tone. No jargon. No exclamation points." |
| Audience profile | "My clients are DTC brand founders, 30-45, non-technical" |
| Key business rules | "Never suggest discounting — my brand is premium" |
| Quality standards | "Always ask before sending anything client-facing" |
| Formatting defaults | "Use bullet points, not long paragraphs. Keep emails under 200 words." |

**Things to leave out:**

| Skip this | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| This week's tasks | Changes too often — say it in conversation instead |
| API keys or passwords | Never put secrets in any file |
| Detailed revenue numbers | Too sensitive for a project file |
| Temporary instructions | CLAUDE.md is for stable rules |

**The test:** *"Would I want Claude to know this six months from now?"* If yes, put it in CLAUDE.md. If no, say it in conversation.

## Structure Template

Here's a proven structure. You can ask Claude to create this file for you:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Who I Am
I'm a [your role]. I run [brief business description].

## My Business
- Business model: [how you make money]
- Clients/customers: [who you serve]
- Current focus: [what you're working on this quarter]

## Communication Rules
- Tone: [direct / warm / professional]
- Format: [bullets, short paragraphs, your preference]
- Length: [concise / thorough]
- Audience: [who usually reads what Claude writes for you]

## Non-Negotiables
- Always ask before making changes to client-facing content
- Never assume — ask clarifying questions when unclear
- [Add your own rules here]

## Quality Checklist
Before delivering any output, verify:
- [ ] Matches my tone and style
- [ ] Accurate — no made-up facts
- [ ] Actionable — clear next steps
- [ ] Appropriate length
```

## Temporary Rules With the # Symbol

Sometimes you want a rule for just this session — not permanently. Use the `#` symbol at the Claude Code prompt:

```
# For this conversation, write all output in British English
```

This rule applies only to the current session. It's gone when you restart Claude Code.

<Callout type="info">
**The workflow:** Experiment with `#` rules in conversation. When you find one you want to keep permanently, add it to your CLAUDE.md.
</Callout>

## The CLAUDE.md Hierarchy

Claude Code checks for CLAUDE.md files at multiple levels, and they stack:

| Level | Location | Scope |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Global** | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Rules that apply to everything you do with Claude Code |
| **Project** | `/your-project/CLAUDE.md` | Rules for one specific project |
| **Directory** | `/your-project/subfolder/CLAUDE.md` | Rules for a specific area within a project |
| **Local** | `CLAUDE.local.md` | Personal rules, git-ignored — won't be shared if you share the project |

<Callout type="info">
**For most people, you'll use two levels:**
1. A **global** CLAUDE.md with your identity and universal style preferences
2. A **project** CLAUDE.md for each major project or area of your business
</Callout>

## Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Be specific: "Never use exclamation points" | Be vague: "Keep it professional" |
| Use imperative language: "ALWAYS cite sources" | Use suggestions: "It might be nice to cite sources" |
| Provide context: "No discounting — my brand is premium" | Give rules without reasons |
| Keep it scannable with headers and bullets | Write it as a wall of text |
| Review quarterly, remove what's stale | Let it grow forever without pruning |

**Target length:** 50-200 lines. Enough to be useful, short enough that Claude processes it quickly.

<Callout type="idea">
**Signal:** If you find yourself correcting Claude on the same thing more than twice, that correction should be in your CLAUDE.md.
