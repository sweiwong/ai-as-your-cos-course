**Run `/start-1-5` in Claude Code to begin the interactive exercises for this lesson.**

## What Are Agents?

So far, you've been talking to one Claude — ask a question, get an answer, ask another question. That works, but it's sequential. One thing at a time.

Agents change this. When you ask Claude to use agents, it spins up multiple independent instances that work at the same time. Each agent:

- Gets its own task
- Works independently (agents can't see what other agents are doing)
- Reports results back to the main session
- Runs in parallel with the other agents

<Callout type="idea">
**Real-world analogy:** You need four competitor profiles before a strategy meeting. Instead of writing them one at a time (an hour), you hand each one to a different team member and they all work simultaneously (fifteen minutes).
</Callout>

## Sequential vs. Parallel

| Approach | 10 documents to summarize | Time |
|----------|--------------------------|------|
| **Sequential** (no agents) | Summarize one, then the next, then the next... | ~50 minutes |
| **Parallel** (with agents) | Summarize all 10 at once | ~5 minutes |

The time savings are real. Agents are one of the biggest productivity multipliers in Claude Code.

## When to Use Agents

**Agents are great for:**

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Batch processing | Summarize 10 documents at once |
| Parallel research | Research 5 competitors simultaneously |
| Multiple perspectives | Get strategist, editor, and devil's advocate views on the same document |
| Document generation | Create proposals for multiple clients at once |
| Time-sensitive work | Morning prep that would otherwise take an hour |

**Skip agents when:**

| Situation | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Single, simple task | One Claude is enough — agents add overhead |
| Tasks that depend on each other | Agent 2 can't use Agent 1's results mid-task |
| Quick questions | "What time is it in Tokyo?" doesn't need parallel workers |
| Context-heavy work | Each agent starts fresh without the conversation history |

## Four Ways to Prompt for Agents

<Tabs items={["Explicit", "Implicit", "Specialized Roles", "Let Claude Decide"]}>
<Tab>

**Be explicit about the number:**

```
Create 3 agents to do the following:
- Agent 1: Read @client-a-notes.md and draft a project update email
- Agent 2: Read @client-b-notes.md and draft a project update email
- Agent 3: Read @client-c-notes.md and draft a project update email

After all three are done, compile the key themes across all clients.
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

**Describe the work and let Claude parallelize:**

```
I have 8 meeting transcripts in the /meetings/ folder.
Process all of them in parallel — summarize each one and
extract action items. Then compile a master action list.
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

**Assign different roles to different agents:**

```
I need help preparing a client proposal. Launch 3 agents
with different perspectives:

Agent 1 (Researcher): Look at @client-brief.md and research
what similar companies in their industry are doing.

Agent 2 (Strategist): Read @client-brief.md and outline
3 possible approaches we could propose.

Agent 3 (Writer): Draft the executive summary based on
@client-brief.md.

Then synthesize all three into a coherent proposal outline.
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

**Just describe the goal:**

```
Analyze the competitive landscape for Stillpoint. There are
four competitor profiles in the research/ folder. Give me a
comprehensive view that I can use for a board presentation.
```

Claude decides whether to use agents and how many based on the task.

## Orchestration Patterns

Here are five common ways to structure agent work:

| Pattern | What happens | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Fan out** | Same task, many files | Summarize each file in a folder |
| **Specialized roles** | Different analysis types on the same input | Strategist + editor + critic review a proposal |
| **Parallel research** | Same question about different subjects | Research 4 competitors simultaneously |
| **Batch generation** | Create similar documents with different details | Draft emails for 6 clients |
| **Validation pipeline** | One agent creates, another reviews | Draft a report, then have it fact-checked |

## Always Include Synthesis

<Callout type="warn" title="Key rule">
**Always ask for synthesis in your prompt.** Without it, you get raw outputs from each agent with no summary. Add a line like: "After all agents finish, synthesize the key findings into a single summary."
</Callout>

Agents don't talk to each other. They don't share results mid-task. Claude compiles everything after they finish — but only if you ask for it.

## Start the Exercises

Switch to Claude Code and run:
