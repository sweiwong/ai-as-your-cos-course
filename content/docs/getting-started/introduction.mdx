## Overview

Claude Code is an AI assistant that works directly with your files and folders ON your computer. Unlike traditional chatbots where you manually copy-paste context into it, Claude Code reads your documents, analyzes data, and creates materials directly through natural conversation.

Key takeaway: Claude Code transforms YOU from manual executors into orchestrators. You focus on strategic decisions while Claude handles document synthesis, data analysis, and workflow automation.

## What You'll Learn

This course teaches you five core capabilities, one building block at a time:

| Capability | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **File operations** | Claude reads and works with your actual files — documents, notes, spreadsheets — without copy-paste |
| **Conversation that sticks** | Start where you left off, not from zero every time |
| **Project memory** | A file called CLAUDE.md that teaches Claude your business rules, your tone, and your priorities — permanently |
| **Sub Agents** | Claude can run multiple tasks at the same time, like having several assistants working in parallel - research agent, marketing agent, legal agent |
| **Daily workflows** | Repeatable routines — morning planning, research, inbox triage, meeting prep, document handling — that Claude handles for you |

## How This Course Is Structured

| Module | What It Covers | Time |
|---|---|---|
| **Module 0: Getting Started** | Install Claude Code and get your first session running | ~20 min |
| **Module 1: Claude as Your Chief of Staff** | Core skills — files, memory, agents, workflows | ~2 hours |
| **Module 2: Context** | Build your identity, business context, and style guide | ~1 hour |

Each lesson follows the same pattern:
1. **Overview** — what you're learning and why it matters
2. **Walkthrough** — step-by-step explanation with examples
3. **Copy-paste prompts** — ready to use immediately
4. **Try It** — a small exercise to practice what you learned

## Who This Course Is For

You're a solopreneur, founder, consultant, or operator. You're smart and experienced, but you're not technical. You don't write code, and you don't need to. You want an AI tool that actually fits into how you already work — not a toy that requires you to learn programming.

## The Mindset Shift

The biggest shift in using Claude Code isn't technical. It's this:

> **Stop thinking "What command do I type?" Start thinking "What outcome do I need?"**

You don't need to memorize commands. You describe what you want in plain English, and Claude figures out how to do it. Your job is to be clear about the *what* and the *why* — Claude handles the *how*.

## Real Use Cases

These aren't hypothetical. This is Claude Code doing actual work — the kind that used to take you an afternoon.
