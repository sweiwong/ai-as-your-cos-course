title: "2.1: Who Am I"
description: Build your identity context file so Claude understands your role, goals, and constraints — and gives you better answers every time.
---

## Overview

In Lesson 1.1, you wrote an identity statement and pasted it into Claude. That was a good start, but it disappears when you close the session. This lesson makes it permanent.

You're going to create a dedicated identity context file — a document that tells Claude who you are, what you do, and what matters to you. When this file lives in your project folder and your CLAUDE.md references it, Claude reads it automatically. Every session starts with Claude already knowing you.

This is the single highest-leverage thing you can do to improve Claude's output. Generic AI gives generic answers. AI that knows you gives *useful* answers.

## What You'll Learn

- How to write an identity context file
- What to include (and what to skip)
- How identity context changes Claude's output (with before/after examples)
- Three complete persona examples you can adapt

## The Before and After

Here's why this matters. Same prompt, dramatically different output.

<Tabs items={["Without Context", "With Context"]}>
<Tab>

**Prompt:**
```
Help me write a LinkedIn post about the importance of systems in business.
```

**Claude's output:**
> "Systems are the backbone of any successful business. Whether you're a startup or a Fortune 500 company, having the right systems in place can make or break your growth trajectory. Here are 5 reasons every business needs better systems: 1) Scalability..."

Generic. Could be written by anyone for anyone. You'd never post this.

</Tab>
<Tab>

**Prompt (with identity file loaded):**
```
Help me write a LinkedIn post about the importance of systems in business.
```

**Claude's output:**
> "Last month I spent 4 hours tracking down a client invoice that should have taken 2 minutes. That's when I knew my business had outgrown my spreadsheet.
>
> I'm an operations consultant. I literally help other companies fix their systems. And yet my own invoicing process was a mess.
>
> Here's what I've learned after 6 years of solo consulting: the systems you need at $50K/year are completely different from the ones you need at $200K. What worked when I had 2 clients breaks down at 8..."

Specific. Personal. Sounds like a real person with a real business. That's the power of identity context.

## The Identity Context Template

Create a file called `who-am-i.md` in your project (or wherever you keep your context files). Here's the structure:

```markdown
# Who I Am

## Role
[One sentence: what you do and who you do it for]

## Background
[2-3 sentences: your experience, expertise, what makes you credible]

## Business Model
- Revenue sources: [how you make money]
- Price range: [rough numbers — helps Claude calibrate advice]
- Client type: [who pays you]
- Team: [solo / contractors / small team]

## Current Stage
[Where your business is right now — early, growing, pivoting, established]

## This Quarter's Priorities
1. [Priority 1 — be specific]
2. [Priority 2]
3. [Priority 3]

## Constraints
- [Time constraints — e.g., "I work 30 hours/week by choice"]
- [Budget constraints — e.g., "Bootstrap only, no outside funding"]
- [Capacity constraints — e.g., "Can only take on 5 clients at a time"]

## What Drains My Energy
- [The tasks you dread or procrastinate on]
- [The things that take too long]
- [The stuff that falls through the cracks]

## What I Want AI to Help With
- [Be specific — not "everything" but actual tasks]
```

## Role
Independent operations consultant helping e-commerce brands
($1M-$10M revenue) streamline their fulfillment and customer service.

  monthly retainers ($3K-$5K/month for 2-3 clients)
- Price range: $180K-$220K annual revenue target
- Client type: DTC brand founders and ops directors

without burning out. Exploring group programs and digital products.

that customers love.

# Who I Am

## Role
Freelance brand strategist and copywriter working with
startups and small agencies.

website copy. Have worked with 80+ brands across tech, food,
and wellness.

  who need senior-level strategy without a full-time hire

Want to create a fixed-scope, fixed-price brand strategy
package that I can sell repeatedly without custom scoping
every time.

## How to Use Your Identity File

Once you've created your identity file, reference it in your CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Context Files
- Read @who-am-i.md for my identity and business context
```

<Callout type="info">
You can also point Claude at it directly in conversation:

```
Read @who-am-i.md — that's my background. Now help me
[whatever you need].
```
</Callout>

## Try It

<Steps>
<Step>
### Pick a persona

Pick the persona example above that's closest to your situation.
</Step>
<Step>
### Customize it

Copy it and replace every detail with your own.
</Step>
<Step>
### Save it

Save it as `who-am-i.md` in your project folder.
</Step>
<Step>
### Test it

Open Claude Code, point it at your file, and ask:

```
Read @who-am-i.md. Based on what you know about me,
what are the three most impactful things you could
help me with this week? Be specific to my business,
not generic.
```
</Step>
</Steps>

If Claude's suggestions feel generic, your identity file needs more specifics. If they feel spot-on, you've nailed it.

When you're ready, move on to **2.2: Company Context**.
