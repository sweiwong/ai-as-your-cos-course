title: "2.3: Personal Style Guide"
description: Teach Claude your communication style so everything it writes sounds like you — not like a robot.
---

## Overview

You've told Claude who you are (Lesson 2.1) and what your business does (Lesson 2.2). This final piece teaches Claude *how you communicate* — your voice, your tone, your preferences, your pet peeves.

This is what separates "useful AI output" from "output I'd actually send." Without a style guide, Claude writes in its default voice — polished, slightly formal, and unmistakably AI. With a style guide, it writes in *your* voice. The goal is output you can use with minimal editing.

## What You'll Learn

- Why style context matters more than people expect
- What to include in a personal style guide
- Before and after examples showing the impact
- A complete style guide sample you can adapt

## The Before and After

Same prompt. With and without a style guide. The difference is striking.

<Tabs items={["Without Style Guide", "With Style Guide"]}>
<Tab>

**Prompt:**
```
Write a LinkedIn post about why solopreneurs should systemize
their client onboarding process.
```

**Claude's output:**
> Streamlining Your Client Onboarding: A Game-Changer for Solopreneurs
>
> As solopreneurs, we often find ourselves wearing multiple hats. One of the most impactful investments you can make in your business is creating a systematized client onboarding process.
>
> Here are three key benefits:
> 1. **Consistency** — Every client gets the same high-quality experience
> 2. **Time Savings** — You'll reduce onboarding time by up to 60%
> 3. **Scalability** — Your business can grow without proportionally increasing your workload
>
> Ready to transform your client experience? Start by documenting your current process and identifying bottlenecks.
>
> #solopreneur #business #productivity #clientexperience

Correct, but bland. Reads like every other LinkedIn post. You wouldn't put your name on this.

**Same prompt, with style guide loaded:**

**Claude's output:**
> I onboarded a new client last month and realized I'd sent them the wrong welcome doc. The one from 2023. With the old pricing.
>
> That was my wake-up call.
>
> I'd been "onboarding" clients the same way for two years: a patchwork of emails sent from memory, a Google Doc I'd update sometimes, and a hope that I wouldn't forget anything important.
>
> I finally spent one afternoon writing it all down. Not a fancy system — just a checklist in a shared doc. Welcome email template. What to send on day 1. What to check on day 7. What to ask at the 30-day mark.
>
> It took 90 minutes to build. It saves me 3 hours every time I use it.
>
> If you're a solopreneur running on memory and good intentions, this is your sign. You don't need software. You need a checklist.

Same topic. Completely different feel. The second version sounds like a real person with a real story. That's what a style guide does.

## Style Guide Template and Example

<Tabs items={["Template", "Complete Example"]}>
<Tab>

Create a file called `style-guide.md` and include these sections:

```markdown
# Personal Style Guide

## Voice and Tone
- [How do you naturally communicate? Direct? Warm? Irreverent?]
- [What's your energy level in writing? Calm? Energetic? Measured?]
- [How formal or casual are you?]

## Writing Patterns
- [Sentence length preference: short and punchy? Longer and flowing?]
- [Paragraph length: one sentence? 2-3 sentences?]
- [Do you use contractions? (e.g., "don't" vs "do not")]
- [Do you use questions rhetorically?]
- [Do you use stories and anecdotes?]

## Words and Phrases I Use
- [List words or phrases that are distinctly "you"]

## Words and Phrases I Never Use
- [List words, jargon, or clichés you hate]

## Formatting Preferences
- [Bullets vs. numbered lists vs. paragraphs]
- [Emoji usage: never / sometimes / often]
- [Headers: formal or conversational?]

## Audience Assumptions
- [What can you assume your reader already knows?]
- [What do you need to explain?]

## Quality Bar
- [What does "good enough to send" look like?]
- [What always needs a second look before sending?]
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

Here's a filled-in example for a solo consultant:

```markdown
# Personal Style Guide

## Voice and Tone
- Direct and warm. Never corporate, never stiff.
- Confident but not arrogant — I share what I know without
  being preachy about it.
- Conversational, like talking to a smart friend over coffee.
- I use humor occasionally, but it's dry and understated.
  Never sarcastic, never at anyone's expense.
- Energy level: calm and steady. Not hyped up, not monotone.

## Writing Patterns
- Short sentences. I rarely go over 15 words.
- Paragraphs are 1-3 sentences max. White space is good.
- I use contractions naturally (don't, can't, won't).
- I open with a specific anecdote or observation, not a
  generic statement.
- I ask rhetorical questions to make a point, but sparingly.
- I end with a clear takeaway or call to action, never with
  "In conclusion..."

## Words and Phrases I Use
- "Here's the thing" (when making a counterintuitive point)
- "This is what actually works" (when cutting through noise)
- "Let me be specific" (before giving concrete details)
- "Not fancy — just clear" (my philosophy in a sentence)
- "That's your sign" (when urging action)

## Words and Phrases I Never Use
- "Synergy," "leverage" (as a verb), "circle back"
- "Game-changer," "unlock," "skyrocket"
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "Dear [name]," in emails (I use "Hey [name]," or just
  start talking)
- Hashtags in LinkedIn posts (I find them desperate)
- "Don't hesitate to reach out" (just say "email me")
- Exclamation points (one per document maximum, and only
  if truly excited)

## Formatting Preferences
- Bullets for lists of 3+ items
- Short paragraphs for narrative or explanation
- No emoji in professional communication
- Headers should be conversational, not formal
  (e.g., "What actually happened" not "Executive Summary")
- Bold for emphasis, never ALL CAPS

## Audience Assumptions
- My reader is smart and experienced in their field
- They don't need business basics explained
- They do need domain-specific concepts explained
  (e.g., if writing about e-commerce ops, define "3PL")
- They're busy — respect their time, get to the point

## Quality Bar
- Could I send this as-is with 5 minutes of editing? If yes,
  it's good enough.
- Does it sound like me or like ChatGPT? Read it out loud —
  if I wouldn't say it that way in a conversation, rewrite it.
- Is there a specific example or story? Generic advice without
  specifics always needs another pass.
- Is it the right length? Too short means it lacks substance.
  Too long means it needs editing. For emails: under 200 words.
  For LinkedIn: under 300 words. For proposals: under 3 pages.

## What Always Needs My Review Before Sending
- Anything going to a client
- Anything with pricing or scope details
- Anything public (social media, website, press)
- Anything with claims about results or numbers
```

## How the Style Guide Changes Everything

With this style guide loaded, Claude handles these tasks dramatically better:

| Task | Without Style Guide | With Style Guide |
|---|---|---|
| Client email | Formal, generic, sounds like a template | Warm, direct, sounds like you |
| LinkedIn post | Buzzword-heavy, forgettable | Personal, specific, shareable |
| Proposal | Cookie-cutter business writing | Your voice, your positioning |
| Follow-up message | "I hope this email finds you well..." | "Hey Sarah — quick update on the project..." |

## Connecting It All Together

You now have three context files:

<Cards>
<Card title="who-am-i.md" description="Your identity and goals — who you are, what you do, and what matters to you." />
<Card title="company-context.md" description="Your business details — what you sell, who you serve, how you make money, and current priorities." />
<Card title="style-guide.md" description="Your communication style — your voice, tone, preferences, and quality bar." />
</Cards>

Reference all three in your CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Context Files
Always read these before starting any task:
- @who-am-i.md — my identity, role, and priorities
- @company-context.md — business details and current projects
- @style-guide.md — how I communicate and what "good" looks like
```

With this in place, Claude starts every session already knowing:
- Who you are
- What your business does
- How you communicate

That's your Chief of Staff, ready to work.

## Try It

1. Copy the style guide template and fill it in with your own preferences
2. Save it as `style-guide.md` in your project folder
3. Test it with this side-by-side comparison:

<Tabs items={["Without Style Guide", "With Style Guide"]}>
<Tab>

**First, without the style guide:**
```
Write a short LinkedIn post about a lesson I learned
in business recently.
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

**Then, with the style guide:**
```
Read @style-guide.md for my communication style.
Now write a short LinkedIn post about a lesson I learned
in business recently. The lesson is: [pick something real
from your experience].
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Compare the two outputs. The difference should be obvious. If it's not, your style guide needs more specific details — especially in the "Words I Use" and "Words I Never Use" sections. Those are what give Claude your actual voice.

## What's Next

<Callout type="success">
Congratulations — you've completed the course. You now have:

- Claude Code installed and running
- Core skills: files, memory, agents, workflows
- A complete context layer: identity, business, and style

From here, the most important thing is to **actually use it**. Pick one workflow from Lesson 1.5 and run it every day for a week. That's how Claude goes from "interesting tool" to "indispensable partner."

The more context you give Claude over time, the better it gets. Update your files as your business evolves. Add new workflows as you discover what saves time. Build new sub-agents as you identify roles you need help with.

Your AI Chief of Staff is ready. Put it to work.
