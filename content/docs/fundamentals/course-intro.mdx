**Run `/start-1-1` in Claude Code to begin the interactive exercises for this lesson.**

## Learning by Doing

This course teaches Claude Code through hands-on practice — not videos, not lectures, not theory. You'll learn by doing real tasks in your terminal, with this website as your reference guide.

Every lesson has two parts:

| Part | Where | What |
|------|-------|------|
| **Interactive exercises** | In your terminal (Claude Code) | Hands-on practice with `/start` commands |
| **Reference guide** | This website | Explanations, examples, and context |

You can go back and forth between the two. The exercises are where the learning happens; the website fills in the "why."

## How Each Lesson Works

<Steps>
<Step>
### Read the lesson page (this website)

Each page explains a concept, shows examples, and gives you the context you need.
</Step>
<Step>
### Run the `/start` command (Claude Code)

Every lesson has a slash command like `/start-1-1` that launches guided exercises in your terminal. Claude walks you through practice tasks using real files in your course project.
</Step>
<Step>
### Check your work

Each exercise includes criteria so you can tell if it worked.
