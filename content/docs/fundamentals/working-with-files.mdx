title: "1.3: Working with Files"
description: Use the @ symbol to reference files and folders. Learn five patterns for getting real work done.

**Run `/start-1-3` in Claude Code to begin the interactive exercises for this lesson.**

## The @ Symbol

The `@` symbol is how you point Claude at specific files or folders. Instead of describing what's in a file, you reference it directly and Claude reads it.

| Syntax | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `@filename.md` | Reference a specific file |
| `@folder/` | Reference an entire folder |
| `@folder/file.md` | Reference a file in a subfolder |

<Callout type="info">
When you type `@` in Claude Code, it shows an autocomplete list of files in your project. You can start typing to filter. This is faster than remembering exact file paths.
</Callout>

## Five Patterns for Working With Files

These are the core patterns you'll use over and over. Each one solves a different type of task.

### Pattern 1: Single File → Extract

Read one file and pull out what matters.

```
Read @meeting-notes.md and extract the action items into a new file called action-items.md
```

**Use cases:** Meeting notes, handoff documents, research papers, interview transcripts, long emails

---

### Pattern 2: Folder → Synthesize

Read everything in a folder and find the patterns across files.

```
Look at all the files in @feedback/ and synthesize the top themes. What are customers saying most?
```

**Use cases:** Customer feedback, support tickets, survey responses, research notes, competitor analysis

---

### Pattern 3: Apply a Template

Use one file as a template and another as the source material.

```
Create a weekly report from @this-week-notes.md following the format in @templates/weekly-report.md
```

**Use cases:** Weekly reports, client proposals, status updates, meeting agendas

---

### Pattern 4: Image → Analyze

Paste an image directly into Claude Code with `Ctrl+V` (not `Cmd+V` on Mac — this is one case where Ctrl is correct even on Mac).

Claude can analyze:
- Screenshots of competitor websites
- Photos of whiteboards
- Charts and graphs
- UI mockups and wireframes

```
[paste image with Ctrl+V]
What's the key message in this chart? Summarize it in two sentences.
```

---

### Pattern 5: Web → Research

Ask Claude to search the web and bring back what it finds — no more juggling 30 browser tabs.

```
Search for best practices in loyalty program design for small businesses. Give me the top 5 takeaways.
```

Claude finds, reads, and synthesizes web content for you.

## Combining Patterns

The real power comes from combining patterns in a single prompt:

```
Read @client-notes.md, search for current trends in their industry, and create
a briefing document following the format in @templates/briefing.md
```

This combines Pattern 1 (single file), Pattern 5 (web research), and Pattern 3 (apply template) in one request.

## Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Be specific about what you want extracted | Say "look at this file" without saying what you need |
| Tell Claude where to put the output | Leave it to guess whether to create a file or print to screen |
| Use templates for consistent formatting | Describe your format from scratch every time |
| Reference multiple files when you need synthesis | Ask about files one at a time when you need a cross-file view |

<Callout type="idea">
**The shift:** Instead of "let me read these files and figure out the pattern," you say "read these files and tell me the pattern." Claude does the reading; you do the thinking.
