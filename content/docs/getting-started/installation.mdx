## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Claude Subscription** | Claude Pro ($20/month) or Claude Max. Free tier NOT supported. Sign up at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) |
| **Node.js** | Version 18 or higher required. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| **Operating System** | macOS or Windows 10+ |

This takes about 15 minutes. If you hit a snag, there's a troubleshooting section at the bottom.

## Step 1: How to Open Your Terminal

All the commands in this guide need to be typed into your Terminal (also called command line). Here's how to open it:

**Mac:**
1. Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight
2. Type "Terminal"
3. Press Enter

**Windows:**
1. Press the Windows key
2. Type "PowerShell"
3. Press Enter

You'll see a window with a blinking cursor — this is where you'll type commands.

## Step 2: Quick Installation

### Check Node.js Version

Open your terminal and type this command, then press Enter:
```bash
node --version
```

If you see `v18.0.0` or higher, proceed to installation. Otherwise, install Node.js first.

### Install Node.js (If Needed)

**Recommended:** Download the LTS version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

**Using Package Managers:**

| Platform | Command |
|---|---|
| macOS | `brew install node` |
| Windows | `choco install nodejs` |

<Callout type="warning">
After installing Node.js, completely close your terminal window and open a new one. This refreshes your system's PATH so it recognizes the `node` command.
</Callout>

## Step 3: Install Claude Code

In your terminal, run this command:

**Mac:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

Wait for the installation to complete. You'll see a success message when it's done.

## Step 4: Verify Claude Code Is Installed

Run this command:

```bash
claude --version
```

You should see a version number. If you do — Claude Code is installed.
If you see `command not found`, completely close your terminal window and open a new one, then try again.

## Step 5: Sign In

Launch Claude Code by typing this into your Terminal and press Enter:

```bash
claude
```

The first time you run it, Claude Code will ask you to sign in:

1. Select **"Claude account with subscription"** when prompted
2. A browser window will open automatically
3. Sign in with your Claude Pro or Max account
4. Come back to the Terminal — you should see Claude Code ready to go

Once signed in, type this inside Claude Code to verify everything is healthy:

```
/doctor
```
This verifies:
- Installation integrity
- Active subscription
- System configuration
- Common issues

This runs a quick health check. If everything is green, you're all set.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| `node: command not found` | Restart your terminal after installing Node.js. If still failing, reinstall from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| `claude: command not found` | Restart your terminal after installing Claude Code. Try running the install command again |
| Node version is below 18 | Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and install the latest LTS version |
| Browser doesn't open for sign-in | Copy the URL shown in the terminal and paste it into your browser manually |
| `/doctor` shows errors | Run the install command again to update Claude Code to the latest version |
| "No subscription found" error | Make sure you have a Claude Pro ($20/mo) or Max subscription at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) |

## Try It

Once Claude Code is running and you've signed in, try asking it something simple to confirm it works:

```
What day of the week is it today?
```

If Claude responds — congratulations, you're set up. Move on to **0.2: Start & Clone** to get your first real project going.
